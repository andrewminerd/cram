To do for multiple project support:

- Merge test results
x - Refactor RunTests to support multiple configs

Before release:
- Update ???
- Documentation
- Delete coverage directories
- Prime notifier with beginning status of tests (from first run)
- Project needs to update FileMonitor when rerunning tests

It'd be nice:
- Store current # of failed, add to notifications
- Change notification messages based on last status
- Monitor bootstrap file and rerun all tests on modification
- Monitor configuration file and rerun all tests on modification

Someday:
- Combine multiple modifications into file delta?
- Clear coverage when a file is deleted (for that file)?
- Merge coverage XML files?
- Generate coverage report?
- Add coverage object to test result?
